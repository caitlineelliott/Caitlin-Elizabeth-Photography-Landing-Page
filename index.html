                        My name is Caitlin Elliott and I am so excited to capture your big day! The whole wedding
                        process is
                        so special to me, and I love being able to come alongside couples, learn their stories, and help
                        document this important season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been a professional photographer for 9 years, and, in that time, I've had the privilege of
                        photographing weddings all over the world. Some of my favorite destination weddings were in the
                        <a href="#">Great Smoky Mountains</a>, <a href="#">Edinburgh</a>, and <a href="#">Riviera
                            Maya</a>!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My team has grown from just me and my camera to <a href="#">a staff of 10 photographers</a> in
                        our
                        collective. Because we all work together under one umbrella, we're able to
                        capture all the facets of your day in perfect detail. We can't wait to work with you!
